        number to it. For example if the current layer is 5, and `r_seed` is 2, generate the wts/bias in this layer
        using a seed of 7 (2+5). Remember, we don't always pass in a numeric `r_seed` (i.e. if we do not want to

        Hints:
        -----------
        Here is the general strategy for this method:
            - Maintain indices for the upstream (i,j) (d_upstream) position
                and another set for the self.input indices (x, y).
                Remember input_xy >= d_upstream_ij due to the pooling.
                Remember to update the input indicies using the strides, d_upstream indices increment by 1.
            - Find within each sliding pooling window position the INDEX of the most active input
                (when the network was running in forward mode).
            - Within the current window, we update the value of dprev_net_act, but only at the
                max index from the forward pass (i.e. the position of the input value that got thru during the forward
                pass).
                We -accumulate- the current d_upstream value here (not the input value).
            - If you use argmax, it results a LINEAR index, but it might be useful to have the corresponding SUBSCRIPT
                index. For example, if the 2x2 window is [[0, 1], [9, 0]], argmax will return 2, but we want
                (x, y)=(0, 1). Check out the provided helper function: ind2sub(self, ind, sz) to convert linear indices
                to subscripts.

        2. Initialize this layer's bias terms to a 1d ndarray (same way as usual).
        Each unit in this layer has its own bias term.

        NOTE: For simplicity, if we are using a random seed to generate wts, you will provide a single `r_seed`
        value for the entire network. This could accidentially introduce correlations in the initial wts across the net.
        To prevent this, we want to use a unique the random seed to generate the wts in this layer (i.e. that is
        different from the other layers). To achieve this in a simple way, take `r_seed` and add the current layer
        number to it. For example if the current layer is 5, and `r_seed` is 2, generate the wts/bias in this layer
        using a seed of 7 (2+5). Remember, we don't always pass in a numeric `r_seed` (i.e. if we do not want to
        control the random weight initialization process).
