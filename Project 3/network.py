        Parameters:
        ----------

            Training data.
        y_train: ndarray. shape=(num training samples,).
            Training data classes, int coded.
        x_validate: ndarray. shape=(num validation samples, n_chans, img_y, img_x).
            Every so often during training (see acc_freq param), we compute
            the accuracy of the network in classifying the validation set
            (out-of-training-set generalization). This is the data we use.
        y_validate: ndarray. shape=(num validation samples,).
            Validation data classes, int coded.
        mini_batch_sz: int.

        n_epochs: int.
            Number of training epochs.
        print_every: int.
            Controls the frequency (in iterations/mini-batches) with which to wait before printing out the
            loss, accuracy, and iteration/mini-batch number.
            NOTE:
            - Previously, you used number of epochs rather than iterations to measure the frequency
            of print-outs. Use the simpler-to-implement units of iterations here because CNNs are
            more computationally intensive and you may want some print-outs during an epoch.
            - It is a computationally intensive process for the CNN to compute training and validation accuracies.
            So only compute training and validation set accuracies on iterations when you print.
            (i.e DON'T compute them every iteration).

        --------
        self.loss_history: list.
            Record of training loss computed over each mini-batch of training for every epoch.
        self.train_acc_history. list.
            Record of accuracy on training set computed on entire training set computed every `print_every` training iters.
        self.validation_acc_history
            Record of accuracy on val set computed on val training set computed every `print_every` training iters.

        TODO: Complete this method's implementation.
        - It should follow the familar format for a training loop: Randomly sampling to get a mini-batch,
        doing the forward and backward pass, computing the loss, updating the wts/biases.
            - NOTE: There is a provided weight update method in Layer called `update_weights`.
        - Add support for `print_every`.
        - Use the Python time module to print out the runtime (in minutes) for iteration 0 only.

        consider the time taken for computing train and validation accuracy).

        input_shape: tuple. By default: (n_chans, img_y, img_x)
            Shape of a SINGLE input sample (no mini-batch).
        n_kers: tuple.
            Number of kernels/units in the 1st convolution layer. Format is (32,), which is a tuple rather than just an
            int. The reasoning is that if you wanted to create another Conv2D layer, say with 16 units, n_kers would
            then be (32, 16). Thus, this format easily allows us to make the net deeper.
        ker_sz: tuple.
            x/y size of each convolution filter. Format is (7,), which means make 7x7 filters in the FIRST Conv2D layer.
            If we had another Conv2D layer with filters size 5x5, it would be ker_sz=(7,5)
        dense_interior_units: tuple. Same format as above.
            Number of hidden units in each dense layer.
            NOTE: Does NOT include the output layer, which has # units = # classes.
        pooling_sizes: tuple.  Same format as above.
            Pooling extent in the i-th MaxPool2D layer.
        pooling_strides: tuple.  Same format as above.
            Pooling stride in the i-th MaxPool2D layer.
        n_classes: int.
            Number of classes in the input. This will become the number of units in the Output Dense layer.
        wt_scale: float.
            Global weight scaling to use for all layers with weights
        reg: float.
            Regularization strength
        r_seed: int or None.
            Random seed for setting weights and bias parameters.
        verbose: bool. Do we want to term network-related debug print outs on?
            NOTE: This is different than per-layer verbose settings, which are turned manually on below.

        NOTE:
        - Remember to define self.wt_layer_inds as the list indicies in self.layers that have weights.
