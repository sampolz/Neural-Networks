def conv2_gray(img, kers, verbose=True):
    '''Does a 2D convolution operation on GRAYSCALE `img` using kernels `kers`.
    Uses 'same' boundary conditions.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    img: ndarray. Grayscale input image to be filtered. shape=(height img_y (px), width img_x (px))
    kers: ndarray. Convolution kernels. shape=(Num kers, ker_sz (px), ker_sz (px))
        NOTE: Kernel should be square and [ker_sz < img_y] and [ker_sz < img_x]
    verbose: bool. I suggest making helpful print statements showing the shape of various things
        as you go. Only execute these print statements if verbose is True.

    Returns:
    -----------
    filteredImg: ndarray. `img` filtered with all the `kers`. shape=(Num kers, img_y, img_x)

    Hints:
    -----------
    - Remember to flip your kernel since this is convolution!
    - Be careful of off-by-one errors, especially in setting up your loops. In particular, you
    want to align your convolution so that it starts aligned with the top-left corner of your
    padded image and iterate until the right/bottom sides of the kernel fall in the last pixel on
    the right/bottom sides of the padded image.
    - Use the 'same' padding formula for compute the necessary amount of padding to have the output
    image have the same spatial dimensions as the input.
    - I suggest using indexing/assignment to 'frame' your input image into the padded one.

def conv2(img, kers, verbose=True):
    '''Does a 2D convolution operation on COLOR or grayscale `img` using kernels `kers`.
    Uses 'same' boundary conditions.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    img: ndarray. Input image to be filtered. shape=(N_CHANS, height img_y (px), width img_x (px))
        where n_chans is 1 for grayscale images and 3 for RGB color images
    kers: ndarray. Convolution kernels. shape=(Num filters, ker_sz (px), ker_sz (px))
        NOTE: Each kernel should be square and [ker_sz < img_y] and [ker_sz < img_x]

    Returns:
    -----------
    filteredImg: ndarray. `img` filtered with all `kers`. shape=(Num filters, N_CHANS, img_y, img_x)

    What's new:
    -----------
    - N_CHANS, see above.

    Hints:
    -----------
    - You should not need more for loops than you have in `conv2_gray`.
    - When summing inside your nested loops, keep in mind the keepdims=True parameter of np.sum and
    be aware of which axes you are summing over. If you use keepdims=True, you may want to remove
    singleton dimensions.

def conv2nn(imgs, kers, bias, verbose=True):
    '''General 2D convolution operation suitable for a convolutional layer of a neural network.
    Uses 'same' boundary conditions.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    imgs: ndarray. Input IMAGES to be filtered. shape=(BATCH_SZ, n_chans, img_y, img_x)
        where batch_sz is the number of images in the mini-batch
        n_chans is 1 for grayscale images and 3 for RGB color images
    kers: ndarray. Convolution kernels. shape=(n_kers, N_CHANS, ker_sz, ker_sz)
        NOTE: Each kernel should be square and [ker_sz < img_y] and [ker_sz < img_x]
    bias: ndarray. Bias term used in the neural network layer. Shape=(n_kers,)
        i.e. there is a single bias per filter. Convolution by the c-th filter gets the c-th
        bias term added to it.
    verbose: bool. I suggest making helpful print statements showing the shape of various things
        as you go. Only execute these print statements if verbose is True.

    What's new (vs conv2):
    -----------
    - Multiple images (mini-batch support)
    - Kernels now have a color channel dimension too
    - Collapse (sum) over color channels when computing the returned output images
    - A bias term

    Returns:
    -----------
    output: ndarray. `imgs` filtered with all `kers`. shape=(BATCH_SZ, n_kers, img_y, img_x)

    Hints:
    -----------
    - You may need additional loop(s).
    - Summing inside your loop can be made simpler compared to conv2.
    - Adding the bias should be easy.

def get_pooling_out_shape(img_dim, pool_size, strides):
    '''Computes the size of the output of a max pooling operation along one spatial dimension.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    img_dim: int. Either img_y or img_x
    pool_size: int. Size of pooling window in one dimension: either x or y (assumed the same).
    strides: int. Size of stride when the max pooling window moves from one position to another.

    -----------
    int. The size in pixels of the output of the image after max pooling is applied, in the dimension
        img_dim.

def max_pool(inputs, pool_size=2, strides=1, verbose=True):
    ''' Does max pooling on inputs. Works on single grayscale images, so somewhat comparable to
    `conv2_gray`.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    inputs: Input to be filtered. shape=(height img_y, width img_x)
    pool_size: int. Pooling window extent in both x and y.
    strides: int. How many "pixels" in x and y to skip over between successive max pooling operations
    verbose: bool. I suggest making helpful print statements showing the shape of various things
        as you go. Only execute these print statements if verbose is True.

    Returns:
    -----------
    outputs: Input filtered with max pooling op. shape=(out_y, out_x)
        NOTE: out_y, out_x determined by the output shape formula. The input spatial dimensions are
        not preserved (unless pool_size=1...but what's the point of that? :)

    NOTE: There is no padding in the max-pooling operation.

    Hints:
    -----------
    - You should be able to heavily leverage the structure of your conv2_gray code here
    - Instead of defining a kernel, indexing strategically may be helpful
    - You may need to keep track of and update indices for both the input and output images
    - Overall, this should be a simpler implementation than `conv2_gray`
