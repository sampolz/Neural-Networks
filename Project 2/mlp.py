class MLP:
    '''MLP is a class for multilayer perceptron network.

    The structure of our MLP will be:

    Input layer (X units) ->
    Hidden layer (Y units) with Rectified Linear activation (ReLu) ->
    Output layer (Z units) with softmax activation

    Due to the softmax, activation of output neuron i represents the probability that the current input sample belongs
    to class i.

        input layer, hidden layer, and output layer. Since the input layer represents each input

        Parameters:
        -----------
        num_input_units: int. Num input features

        standard deviation `std` and mean of 0. For consistency with the test code, initialize the parameters in that
        order.

        - Initialize the biases (self.y_b and self.z_b) using the usual strategy.

        NOTE: Implement all forward computations within this function
        (don't divide up into separate functions for net_in, net_act). Doing this all in one method is not good design,
        but as you will discover, having the forward computations (y_net_in, y_net_act, etc) easily accessible in one
        place makes the backward pass a lot easier to track during implementation. In future projects, we will rely on
        better OO design.

        I added dz_net_act for you to start with, which is your cross-entropy loss gradient.
        Next, tackle dz_net_in, dz_wts and so on.

        I suggest numbering your forward flow equations and process each for relevant gradients in reverse order until
        you hit the first set of weights.

        -------------------------------------
        1. Record accuracy on the validation set (`x_validation`, `y_validation`) after each epoch training.
        2. Record accuracy on training set after each epoch training.

        (see note below for more details)

        Parameters:
        -----------
        features: ndarray. shape=(Num samples N, num features).
            Features over N inputs.
        y: ndarray.
            int-coded class assignments of training samples. 0,...,numClasses-1
        x_validation: ndarray. shape=(Num samples in validation set, num features).
            This is used for computing/printing the accuracy on the validation set at the end of each epoch.
        y_validation: ndarray.
            int-coded class assignments of validation samples. 0,...,numClasses-1
        n_epochs: int.
            Number of training epochs
        lr: float.
            Learning rate
        mini_batch_sz: int.
            Batch size per epoch. i.e. How many samples we draw from features to pass through the model per training epoch
            before we do gradient descent and update the wts.
        reg: float.
            Regularization strength used when computing the loss and gradient.
        r_seed: None or int.
            Random seed for weight initialization.
        verbose: int.
            0 means no print outs. Any value > 0 prints Current epoch number and training loss every
            `print_every` (e.g. 100) epochs.
        print_every: int. How often (in epochs) to print loss and accuracy.
            If verbose > 0, print out the training loss and validation accuracy over the last epoch
            every `print_every` epochs.
            Example: If there are 20 epochs and `print_every` = 5 then you print-outs happen on
            after completing epochs 0, 5, 10, and 15 (or 1, 6, 11, and 16 if counting from 1).

        -----------
        loss_history: Python list of floats. len=`n_epochs * n_iter_per_epoch`.

            Recorded accuracy on every epoch on the training set.
        validation_acc_history: Python list of floats. len=`n_epochs`.
            Recorded accuracy on every epoch on the validation set.

        NOTE:
        The flow of this method should follow the one that you wrote in `SoftmaxLayer`. The main differences are:
        0) Remember to update weights and biases for ALL layers!
        1) Record the accuracy:
            - on training set: Compute it on the ENTIRE training set only after completing an epoch.
            - on validation set: Compute it on the ENTIRE validation set only after completing an epoch.
        2) As in `SoftmaxLayer`, loss on training set should be recorded for each mini-batch of training.
        3) Every `print_every` iterations, print out (if `verbose` is `True`):
