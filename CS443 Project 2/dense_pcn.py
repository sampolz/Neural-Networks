        bidirectionally to one another.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        input_feats_shape: tuple of ints.
            The shape of input data WITHOUT the batch dimension.
            Example: If the input are 32x32 RGB images, input_feats_shape=(32, 32, 3).
        C: int.
            Number of classes in the dataset.
        hidden_units: tuple of ints.
            The number of units in each hidden layer of the PCN.
            Example: (256, 128) means the PCN has 2 hidden layers, the 1st with 256 hidden units and the 2nd hidden
            layer has 128 units.
        wt_scale: float.
            The standard deviation of the layer weights when initialized according to a standard normal distribution
            ('normal' method).
        gamma_lr: float.
            The strength with which the predictive feedforward and feedback signals affect the layer's evolving state.
        train_num_steps: int.
            Number of steps/iterations/sweeps to use when updating the state of each layer in the net during training.
        test_num_steps: int.
            Number of steps/iterations/sweeps to use when updating the state of each layer in the net during inference.

        TODO:
        1. Call the superclass constructor to handle any overlapping fields.
        2. Build out the PCN — input layer, the prescribed number of hidden layers, and the output layer.
        Connect up the layers appropriately. This means the input layer has a next connection (but not a prev one),
        the hidden layers are connected to the prev and next layers, and the ouput layer only has a prev connection.
        3. Keep track of your layers by inserting them into self.layers and assign the output layer to self.output_layer
        to make sure your network works with your existing `DeepNetwork` and `Layer` code.
        4. Create instance variables for parameters as needed.
