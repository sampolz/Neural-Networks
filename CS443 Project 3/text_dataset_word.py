        Parameters:

        N_reviews: int.
            Number of reviews to retrieve/return sequentially, starting from the first review.
            If the user passes in -1, retrieve ALL available reviews.

        Returns:
        --------
        Python list of str. len=N_reviews

        '''Make the text corpus of the IMDb dataset.

        Transforms text documents (list of strings) into a list of list of words (both Python lists).
        The format is [[<sentence>], [<sentence>], ...], where <sentence> = [<word>, <word>, ...].

        For the IMDb data, this transforms a list of reviews (each is a single string) into a list of
        sentences, where each sentence is represented as a list of string words. So the elements of the
        resulting list are the i-th sentence overall. Note that this means that we lose information about WHICH review
        the sentence comes from, which is useful, but not needed in this project.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        reviews: Python list of str. len=N_reviews
            Retrieved reviews, with each whole review represented as a single string. Formated as:
            [<review 1 str>, <review 2 str>, <review 3 str>, ...]
        min_sent_size: int.
            Don't add sentences LESS THAN this number of words to the corpus (skip over them). This is important because
            it removes empty sentences (bad parsing) and those with not enough word context.

        Returns:
        -----------
        Python list of str.
            The corpus represented as: [[<sentence>], [<sentence>], ...], where <sentence> = [<word>, <word>, ...].

        TODO:
        1. Load in the requested number of reviews and ratings.
        2. Split each review into sentences based on periods, question marks, OR exclamation points.
        3. Tokenize the sentence into individual word strings (via provided `tokenize_words` function in `text_util.py`)
        4. Make sure only sentences get added to the corpus that are AT LEAST as long as the min length.

    def make_target_context_word_lists(self, corpus, word2ind, context_win_sz=2):
        '''Make the target word array ("training samples") and context word array ("classes").

        Parameters:
        -----------
        corpus: Python list of lists of str.
            List of sentences, each of which is a list of words (str).
            Format: [[<sentence>], [<sentence>], ...], where <sentence> = [<word>, <word>, ...]
        word2ind: Dictionary.
            Maps word string -> int code index. Range is [0, vocab_sz-1] inclusive.
        context_win_sz: int.
            How many words to include before/after the target word in sentences for context.

        Returns:
        --------
        tf.int32 tensor. shape=(N,).
            The int-coded target words in the corpus,
        tf.int32 tensor. shape=(N,).
            The int-coded context words.

        Every pair of target and context words occupy the i-th position of the target and context word lists that this
        function builds up. This means that there will likely be chains/sequences of repeating target words (when a
        target word has multiple context words in the context window, which is usually the case).

        Example:
        --------
        corpus = [['neural', 'nets', 'are', 'fun'], ...]
        word2ind: 'neural':0, 'nets':1, 'are':2, 'fun':3
        context_win_sz=1
        Then we will have:
        target_words_int =  [0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
        context_words_int = [1, 0, 2, 1, 3, 2]

        NOTE:
        - As the example above illustrates, the number of context words in the window is NOT constant because of
        sentence edge effects.
        - The length of target_words_int and context_words_int MUST be equal!
